            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            Based on the reading, I think that data are the notes and observations recorded from reasearch and once that data is proecessed into something that is useful or something that can be understood, that is when data becomes information.

         <h5>Q2. From the Manovich reading, what is the difference between visualization and mapping?</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            Manovich explained that visualization and mapping are two closely related subjects - in fact, he states that visualization can be considered as a subset of mapping. However, in his article, he states that visualization is processing data even in terms of something that is not visual, while mapping is the process of mapping one representation into another.

         <h5>Q3. When Manovich states that visualization is the anti-sublime art what is he referring to? Do you agree with this notion?</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            Manovich refers to when visualization artists try map data into something similar to human perception and cognition. In my opinion, I think that visualization and mapping can be both anti-sublime and sublime, as long as it is within that artistic realm. If you want to use these technologcal methods as a means for representation beyond human comprehension or something grandeour, as an artist you have the power to do so.

            Artist chosen: Jennifer Daniel 
            <br>
            Jennifer Daniel is a designer, editor, and illustrator. In her presentation, she talked about our sense of visual vocabulary and the different perceptions of writing and communicating. She also talked about the origins of emojis, and how implementing code didn't occur until westernization of these visuals became about - which was unicode. She decribes how a computer and the human senses can interpreate information similarly, like colors, but also in many varying ways, like visual context. She also relates how this way of communication can be percieved through art. For her, data and visualization meant another means of communication through facial recognition and emotions.

            1. Describe in list form, the stuff as data that can be described as qualities:
               <br>
               - favorites
               <br>
               - texture

               - Value
                <br>
               -  How long you owned it
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Describe in list form, how they could be sorted:
                <br>
               - Edibility/safe for consumption
               <br>
               - material
                <br>
               - Harmful vs. Harmless
                <br>
               - uses(as in what that are used for)
            <br>
                <br>
            3. Describe in list form, how they could be arranged visually (presentation) to help see their relationships better:
                <br>
               - Opacity
               <br>
               - Shape
                <br>
               - pattern
                <br>
               - Aesthetics
            <br>
                <br>
            4. Describe in 2 or 3 sentance, if you can infer anything from this collection of images that would help you summerize any meaning (knowledge). What would a detective or a archaeologist say about this material, and be able to infer anything from it?
            <br>
                <br>
            This activity helped me realize that you can produce data out of pretty much anything. What you think is a useless object has information attached to it and what you infer about that object is already important data in itself. In a detective or archaelogist postion, deciphering an object's qualities can help them find certain information that can lead to other significant findings.
