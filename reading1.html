            Abstract and Summery:
            <br>
                 We used our fingers as measure of units, as well as shapes that needed to be used. Unfortunately, the message wasn’t clear per person so each of us used our own shape. This error should have been established on the instructions so we would be using a constant shape. Although, this was good practice in realizing how important rules are when making and following them.

            <br>
             <h5>Q1. What would be a good definition of how any kind of artist can use an algorithm in their art.</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            Using and manipulating softwares to make art like glitches and patterns in computers. It also is the process of making art like following a color by number book or arts & crafts with instructions.
            </em>
            <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h5>Q2. Give some examples of how you might already use algorithms in your own artwork.</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            An example of using algorithms, especially in the case of using a system, can be interactive art and webdesign.
            </em>
            <br>
            </div>
            <h5>Q3. Look at the 4 artists above and please describe  for each one, 'where' do you think the art is and how would you talk about the process of the 'art' vs the art 'artifact'. For example, If an artist is using computers to generate art, where is the art? Is it in the software program or the product it makes?</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            I believe that if you develop an emotional attachment or it is an emotional process of becoming something than those are considered art. If an artist is using computers, as long as there is an emotional connection to the things it produces, it can be considered art and the creator of that program/software is dubbed the artist.  
            </em>
            <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
             <h5>Q4. What is an example of a well known artist that has an iconic style to you?
             Please summerize a basic 'ingredient list' and process that might create their style.</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            Alot of digital artists, especially ones with a cartoony artstyle, are always ionic to me. In terms of phyisical forms of art, there is Andy Worhol, Vincent Van Gogh, and Banksy. A basic ingrediant list from these artists could be, pencil, paper, paint, canvas, stenci, a wall, a computer, or a tablet. </em>
            <br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h5>Q5. Given that the recipes/instructions are about different subject matter (food, building things, etc)
            Please summerize the differences of all 5 recipes in terms of their style, detail and scope of describing their instructions. How do they describe what the tasks are and why are their styles different?</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            Artwokr is more free form. There is no real instructions or directions to create a masterpiece. There are tutorials to follow but most of the times the artist produced things from unlimited imagination. Building and baking, however, needs measurements and control. There is balance involved and if unbalanced, it could lead to destruction of what you are trying to create. </em>
