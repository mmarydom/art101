		For this assignment, we explored some of the characteristics of programming, as well as the basics and beginnning techniques of Processing. I have used processing before very briefly for art74 but I really delved into this program mostly this year. I was able to create something through code that I was never really familiar with. Some of the basic functions that we used in this exercise were for loops and if and else statements, overloaded functions, data types, and global variables.

		<p>
		This exercise was one of the harder ones to learn, in my opinion, because we went over quite a few more logic statements. This assignment was alot more difficult compared to the last because we went over a few more logic statements. We also went over alot more code than usual, so it was hard to keep up at times. However, after practicing with more sketches, I was able to understand. The code that we learned included rectmode(), nested for loop statements, sin(), data types like float or string, boolean logic options, and the module operator.

		For this assignment, I had the most fun because it was more of buliding your own creation rather than experimenting with code. The lessons were also easier to learn compare to exercise 2, maybe because it has become easier to read and understand code, even by just a little. We played with shapes, as well as learning how to make these shapes rotate. In detail, some of the things that we learned in this assignment were functions with or without arguements, custom functions, parent functions with sub functions, and the push/pop matrix functions, as well as its arguements.

		<p>
		For this project, I was able to create something through code and actually understand what I am doing instead of copying and pasting things that our professor taught us. For this project, we were assigned to create our own canvas with drawing functions. I went towards a monster creation canvas rather than a program used for drawing. With using the tools provided from the sketch example, I decided to create functions that can help the artist add to a base. The canvas consists of a body base with two eyes. Key Q is a thick green stroke, key w is a red thick stroke, key e is a blue thick stroke, key r is yellow rectanlge for textured surface, and key t is an eye pattern. And if you ever want to restart everything, the key X clears the canvas. <br>
