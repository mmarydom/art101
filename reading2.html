         <h5>Q1. From the Manovich reading, give 2 examples of interface or interactions with a piece of technology that has a performative action or theatrical behavior. This is in context with the ideas credited to Brenda Laurel that Lev mentions in the article. They can be electronic/digital or analog but NOT a computer or smart phone. Explain why these are good examples.</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            In the reading, Brenda Laurel explain interactive technology as theatrical behavior. One of the examples that come in mind for me are light sensors that sense movement outside your front lawn. These small lamps are catagorized under this because it has a behavior that requires human interaction. Another example with a similar but different concept are the small robot dogs back in the 2000's. The toys are both interactive and used for pleasurable enjoyment.

         <h5>Q2. Also From the Manovich reading, he uses the term Gesamtkunstwerk. What does this term mean and how is using it to refer to the aestheticization of information tools?</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            The term Gesamtkunstwerk means directly engaging the three senses of sight, hearing and touch, and evoking the fourth sense of taste through the phone's name and color. It is refered to as the aestheticization of information tools when being used because you are altering and adding aesthetic designs to a product while also improving its software.

         <h5>Q3. From the RadioLab Podcast, the guest podcast artist is sharing his radio show called 99% invisible. The first piece is about sound design. What would you describe the role of the sound designer and how does it relate to this idea of theatre and performance?</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            A sound designer's role is very vital to all sorts of projects because their job is to create sound effects through manipulating and recording the noises certain objects makes. This relates to the idea of theatre and performance because sounds breath life to moving objects, especially ones that move against eachother.
            </em>
            <br>
            </div>
            <br>
        <h5>Q4. From the Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design article, what are the philosophical and visual differences between Skeuomorphism vs. Flat Design and how might this also relate to this idea of theatre and gamification described in the Lev Article?</h5>
            <div class="statement_text"> 
            <em>
            The idea of skeuomorphism creates a sense of familiarity by emulating materials, while flat design stays true to its medium. This relates to the idea of theater and gamification of products because of the way you are interacting with technology. Most modern products have a minimulistic design but carry elements of skeuomorphism.
